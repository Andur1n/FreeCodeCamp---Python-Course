# FreeCodeCamp Python Scripts

A collection of scripts I built while working through the FreeCodeCamp Python course.  
Mostly small exercises, practice challenges, and test ideas written along the way.

## Contents
- Course solutions  
- Practice snippets  
- Experimental scripts  

## Purpose
This repo tracks my progress as I learn Python and serves as a reference for concepts I've worked through. It may also be useful to others following a similar path.

These aren't production projects — just part of the learning process and skill-building journey.
